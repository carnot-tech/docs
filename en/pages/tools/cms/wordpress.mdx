## Overview
The Wordpress tool lets you create and publish articles on a Wordpress site. It supports various content formats and allows you to set the status of the article (draft or published).

## Key Features
- `WORDPRESS_POST_ARTICLE`
  - Create and publish articles on Wordpress
  - Supports various content formats (e.g., HTML, Markdown)
  - Options for draft or published status

## Authentication

After setting up your Wordpress site, you need to create an application password for authentication. This is done through the Wordpress admin panel.

**Note**: Treat API keys as sensitive information and never commit them to public repositories.

### Example:
```yaml
name: Wordpress
description: Make a new article on Wordpress
steps:
  - id: wordpress
    name: Post Article
    tool: WORDPRESS_POST_ARTICLE
    config:
      - name: url
        value: https://sample.wordpress.com/
      - name: username
        value: admin
      - name: password
        value: "{{secrets.WORDPRESS_APPLICATION_PASSWORD}}"
    input:
      - name: content
        value: |-
          <h1>Hello World</h1>
          <p>This is a sample post.</p>
      - name: draft
        value: false
