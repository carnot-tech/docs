## Overview

The Firecrawl module provides functionality for automating website crawling and data collection.

## Key Features

- `FIRECRAWL_SCRAPE`
  - Scrape web pages and extract data
  - Supports various output formats (e.g., JSON, CSV)
  - Customizable crawling parameters

## Authentication

If you do not have an API key, you can still run Firecrawl tools by using Jinba API credit. If you'd like to use your own API key, you can obtain one from the [official Firecrawl website](https://www.firecrawl.dev/) and follow the developer documentation.

**Note**: Treat API keys as sensitive information and never commit them to public repositories.

### Example: Scrape Hacker News
```yaml
name: Scrape Hacker News with Firecrawl v1
steps:
  - id: scrape
    tool: FIRECRAWL_SCRAPE
    config:
      - name: token
        value: "{{secrets.FIRECRAWL_API_KEY}}"
