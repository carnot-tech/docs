## Overview
The SerpAPI tool allows you to search the web using SerpAPI's capabilities. It provides a simple interface to query the web and retrieve relevant information based on your input.

## Key Features
- `SERPAPI_SEARCH`
  - Search for information on the web using a query string.
  - Retrieve relevant results based on your input.
  - Get answers to questions, summaries, and more.


## Authentication

If you do not have a SerpAPI API key, you can still run SerpAPI tools by using Jinba API credit. If you'd like to use your own API key, you can obtain one from the [official SerpAPI website](https://serpapi.com/).

**Note**: Treat API keys as sensitive information and never commit them to public repositories.

### Example: Run SerpAPI Search
```yaml
- id: serpapi_search
  tool: SERPAPI_SEARCH
  config:
    - name: token
      value: "{{secrets.SERPAPI_API_KEY}}"
  input:
    - name: query
      value: What is the capital of France?
    - name: engine
      value: google
```
