The Perplexity tool allows you to search the web for information. It is designed to provide quick and accurate answers to your queries by leveraging the power of AI and web search capabilities.

## Key Features

  - Search for information on the web using a query string.
  - Retrieve relevant results based on your input.

## Authentication

If you do not have a Perplexity API key, you can still run Perplexity tools by using Jinba API credit. If you'd like to use your own API key, you can obtain one from the [official Perplexity website](https://www.perplexity.ai/).

**Note**: Treat API keys as sensitive information and never commit them to public repositories.

### Example: Run Perplexity Search

  tool: PERPLEXITY_SEARCH
  config:
    - name: api_key
      value: "{{secrets.PERPLEXITY_API_KEY}}"
