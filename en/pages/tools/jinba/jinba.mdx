## Overview
You can run Jinba Flows using the Jinba Flow tool. This tool allows you to execute flows that have been published on Jinba within another flow.

## Key Features
- `JINBA_FLOW_RUN`
  - This tool allows you to run Jinba Flows by providing the flow ID and any necessary arguments.


## Authentication

After publishing a flow, you can note the flow URL and flow secret to send requests to the flow from this tool or from the web.

**Note**: Treat API keys as sensitive information and never commit them to public repositories.
