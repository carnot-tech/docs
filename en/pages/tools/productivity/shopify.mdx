## Overview
The Shopify tools allow you to manage products and orders in your Shopify store. You can create, update, and delete products, as well as manage orders and inventory.

## Key Features
- `SHOPIFY_LIST_PRODUCTS`
  - Retrieve a list of products from your Shopify store.
- `SHOPIFY_CREATE_PRODUCT`
  - Create a new product in your Shopify store.


## Authentication

To use the Shopify API, you need to create a private app in your Shopify store. This will provide you with the necessary credentials (API key and password) to authenticate your requests.

**Note**: Treat API keys as sensitive information and never commit them to public repositories.
