## Overview
Interact with Gemini with prompts or by sending images. The Gemini tool also allows you to send prompts and receive structured responses.

## Key Features
- `GEMINI_INVOKE`
  - Send prompts to Gemini AI
- `GEMINI_INVOKE_WITH_IMAGE`
  - Send images to Gemini AI for analysis

## Authentication

If you do not have an API key, you can still run Gemini tools by using Jinba API credit. If you'd like to use your own API key, you can obtain one from the [official Gemini website](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key).

**Note**: Treat API keys as sensitive information and never commit them to public repositories.
