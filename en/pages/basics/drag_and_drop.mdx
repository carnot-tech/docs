# Drag & Drop

Click on the + icon in the graph view of the editor in order to see a full list of our available tools. By clicking on the created node, you can see the inputs and configuration needed for it and create basic flows in the side panel.

You can use the top and bottom dots to connect tools to each other to form dependencies, and you can click on the three dots to the right of the tool name to delete it.

You may want to learn to use the manifest editor view in order to make more advanced flows, but advanced options are also available in the `Advanced Options` tab of the side panel.
