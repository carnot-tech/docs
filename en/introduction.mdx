# Jinbaflow Documentation

## Overview

Jinbaflow is a platform designed to facilitate the creation of workflows for LLM (Large Language Model) agents. Users can provide instructions in natural language, and our copilot agent generates a YAML manifest file. These manifest files contain all the necessary information to execute workflows within our runner environment.

Key features:
- Natural language workflow creation through copilot agent
- YAML-based manifest files for workflow definition
- Rich set of integrated tools (LLM, Python, Notion, Gmail, etc.)
- Support for complex workflow patterns including:
  - Sequential and parallel execution
  - Conditional branching
  - Looping and iteration
  - Dynamic variable references
  - Template-based value generation

The platform provides a flexible and powerful way to orchestrate various tools and services into cohesive workflows, making it ideal for automation, data processing, and integration tasks.
